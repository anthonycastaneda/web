# Upgrade VMware Tools with Chocolatey

So you have a urgent security patch for VMware Tools, and you have a **LOT** of virtual servers that you need to patch and reboot, right away.
Easy to do if you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) installed on them.

```powershell
### Get your Servers by OU

$Servers = (Get-ADComputer -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=Servers,DC=contoso,DC=com").Name

### Loop through the servers, enable FIPS mode for chocolatey
### Upgrade VMware Tools with chocolatey and reboot the server if it needs it.

foreach ($Server in $Servers)
{
      Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Server -ScriptBlock {
      choco feature enable -n useFipsCompliantChecksums
      choco upgrade vmware-tools -y
      $exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
      $rebootCode = "3010"

      Write-Verbose "Exit code was $exitCode"
      $validExitCodes = @(0, 1605, 1614, 1641, 3010)
      if  ($validExitCodes -contains $rebootCode)
        {
          Restart-Computer
        }

      elseif ($validExitCodes -contains $exitCode)
      {
        Exit 0
      }

    Exit $exitCode}
}
```

:::tip
If you can't reboot the servers, leave off the **Restart-Computer** bit :smile:
